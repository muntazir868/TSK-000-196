# Pose Detection
 Utilize computer vision techniques to detect and track human poses in images or
videos.
 Use pre-trained models such as OpenPose, PoseNet, or AlphaPose to estimate
joint positions and skeletal structures.
 Process images or video frames and extract pose features.
 Apply algorithms to analyze and interpret poses for specific tasks like fitness
tracking, gesture recognition, or motion analysis.
